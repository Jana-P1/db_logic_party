# DB_Logic_Testing

I created this repo to explore some ideas I have for another app for which I'm still planning and structuring. I wanted to create and test some logic and get my creative juices flowing. This is still a work in progress.

The idea is to display 8 words in the form of clickable buttons that I've chosen at random. Users can add these random their list. After clicking submit, the app will spit out a json blob.
